# KarayollarÄ±

This project scrapes the website of the Turkish General Directorate of Highways to gather information about road works being carried out across the country. The data is then analyzed to gain insights into the types of works being carried out, the issues they address, and the notification and update dates.

## Usage

Run karayollari.py to scrape the data and perform the analysis
The analysis includes bar charts of the different types of works and issues, a pie chart of notification dates, and a word cloud of the works' names.
