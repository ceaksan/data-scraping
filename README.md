# Data Scraping

This repository contains multiple subdirectories, each of which represents a separate scraping project. The purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized location for storing and organizing multiple scraping projects. Currently, this repository contains the following projects:

## T24 Column Scraper

This project scrapes the T24 website to extract the columns written by various columnists and saves them as both HTML and markdown files. The extracted columns can be used for further analysis or archiving.

## Google Chrome Bookmarks Scraper

This project scrapes Google Chrome bookmarks exported as an HTML file to organize the links and save them as CSV and TXT files. The resulting files can be used to better manage and categorize the links.

## KarayollarÄ±

This project scrapes the website of the Turkish General Directorate of Highways to gather information about road works being carried out across the country. The data is then analyzed to gain insights into the types of works being carried out, the issues they address, and the notification and update dates.

### Adding New Projects

I will continue to add new subdirectories for different scraping purposes.

Thank you for using this multi-scraper repository. Happy scraping!
